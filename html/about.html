           <span class="semibold">Hi, my name is Christoper James Lebioda.</span>
           <p>I'm a part-time Graduate student at the University of Michigan studying User Experience Design/User-Centered Agile Design
             at the University of Michigan within the School of Information. I previously got my undergraduate
             degree at the U of M in Computer Science and Economics (check out the timeline on the home page for that
             journey). As a future designer/developer, I want to <span class="highlight">shrink the technology gap for the elderly and children with
             autism.</span>
           </p>
           <br>
           <span class="semibold">I should have known I wanted to work with computers in some form or another early in life.</span>
           <br>
           <p>Growing up, my dad brought home interesting technology because he worked on the entertainment systems at
             Ford. We had the luxery of being able to play Mario Kart on the N64 in the van because he needed real users
             to test the system they were creating. Now that I am writing this, that was my first experience with user design!
             Although the multiple systems he brought home through the years essentially worked the same, he was bridging the gap between
             how things function and how things looked.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>As I left for college in 2013 and my dad slowly turned to the managing side of engineering, I noticed my dad still loves
             technology (playing with Arduinos, figuring out how Chromecast works, etc.), but the cost of entry is much greater than
             before. As technology advances and becomes integrated in or even replaces the most basic aspects of our daily lives, we need
             to ensure the technology itself is <span class="highlight">accessible by all members of our society.</span> Although more and more technologies claim to be
             accessible and inclusive, they often alienate and overwhelm older populations because most products inherently assume their
             users have used something similar in the past. Even if we have the most sophisticated, robust, and well-implemented piece of
             technology, if users cannot understand how it works with relative ease, then the design is a failure. Especially for older adults,
             barriers like lack of instructions and guidance, complexity, and feelings of inadequacy drive them away from even the most
             “accessible” technology. I believe if we better understand the <span class="highlight">perceptions of an older generation</span>, then we can design interfaces
             for them and close the technology age gap.
