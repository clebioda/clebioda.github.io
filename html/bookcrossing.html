        <div class="content">
          <p class="content-margin">BookCrossing is an app my team and I prototyped for the class SI 582: Interaction Design. We decided to develop a
            prototype of a mobile application for Little Free Libraries because although they have a website that includes a map
            to show you where all the libraries are located, it is not user friendly and limites the abiltity to create and sustain
            a community to expand book access for all.</p>
          <div class="section">
            <h2 id="overview">Overview<span class="period period-yellow margin-left"></span></h2>

              <h3>Background<span class="period period-yellow margin-left"></span></h3>
              <p>Little Free Library is a great organization for avid readers to expand book access for all through a global network of
                volunteer-led little libraries, however, their website, specifically the map, is not mobile friendly and makes it
                difficult to find libraries on-the-go. Local residents who do not want to walk aimlessly through their neighborhood
                would have to look up a library on the web and input the library address into a navigation application, which adds
                extra steps to the process. These walkers do not want to have to go home and use their computer to look up more libraries,
                they want an instantaneous way to see other libraries nearby and detour to see them.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="problem" class="paragraph">
              <h3>Problem<span class="period period-yellow margin-left"></span></h3>
              <div class="grid-container-bookcrossing">
              <p>Looking at the picture below, the current mobile view of their map requires the user to input some necessary information
                in order to see any of the libraries in that area. The libraries on the map only have one picture available (that the user cannot
                increase in size to see it), the name, and the location). The quickest way to get directions to this library near you would require you
                to copy the latitude/longitude or address, open up a direction's application, paste the text and then search for your location. Once
                you to the library you were dying to see, you have no way of expressing your gratitude to the owner for the new book you just found or
                the design of their bookcase.</p>

              <p>The primary users that we are targeting are local neighborhood residents who often take walks and enjoy spending their free time
                exploring. Other potential users consist of those who create public bookcases and want to know how people feel about them and
                create a community through their love of sharing books. Additionally, parents of children of poverty will be able to access the
                free libraries in order to support their education.</p>

                <p>Like most mobile applications, we gave our users the ability to opt out of receiving push notifications for directions add
                  nearby libraries and the ability to turn of location tracking. Library owners can verify their email and their library
                  with the organization in order to claim their library and be able to edit their library page and approve or decline comments
                  and pictures from people who have visited.</p>

              <div id="hidden-library" class="grid-container-bookcrossing2">
                <p>Throughout interviewing current little library  owners, one of their main concerns was
                  privacy. Some owners do not want to give out their address and would rather have people stumble upon their library. We added
                  hidden libraries to our application which will not show their address, but still has a profile where users can post their pictures
                  and comments. </p>

              <h3>Map and List View<span class="period period-red margin-left"></span></h3>
              <div class="grid-container-bookcrossing">
                <p>Upon opening the application, the user is either met with a List View of all the libraries near them or a Map View depending
                  on their preferences. The map view contains three buttons in the bottom right corner. The light green buttons show the
                  amount of hidden libraries near them as well as explains what hidden libraries are. During user testing, users were confused
                  as to why more libraries were populated on the list view compared to the map, so we added this clarification. The white button
                  allows users to add a new library they find that is not currently in little free libraries database. The green button toggles
                  between the list view and the map view.</p>
                <a href="#image4">

                </a>
              </div>
              <p>Clicking on the library icon brings up a preview of the library profile where the user can see the name, the distance,
                the address (if available), a button that brings up a directions screen, and a button to the library's full profile. We created
                two views for the libraries because some users want to find the nearest library while they are on their walk in order to have
                an end goal to their walk. The map view exists so users have a digestible medium which shows them all options.
              </p>
              <div class="grid-container-bookcrossing">
                <p>Throughout our interactions, one aspect we got comments on was consistent within the application. One of our original
                  designs had the toggle button in the top left corner of the list view, but near the bottom right corner of the map view
                  because of the available space. This lead us to creating a pop out menu on the list view to keep the placement of the buttons
                  at the same location on both views since they serve the same function.

              <h3>Add and Editing a Library<span class="period period-red margin-left"></span></h3>
              <div class="grid-container-bookcrossing2">
                <p>Currently, if a librarian wants to add their library, they must send
                  an email to the Little Free Library organization and requesting it be added to the map. They are limited to one picture, a
                  short description, a name and an address. If a librarian wants to make another change later, they must send another email
                  and someone from the organization will manually update it. BookCrossing allows the librarian to make any updates within the
                  application where they can add multiple pictures (and use explorer submitted content) and instantaneously update their information
                  without a third party being involved. Librarians can also accept or decline user submitted comments and pictures that can shown
                  on their profile.</p>

              <div class="grid-container-bookcrossing">
                <p>One of the biggest issues with the current Little Free Library map is the simplistic library profile
                  page. Explorers cannot even contribute photo of them holding up their newly acquired book next to bookcase or give a
                  compliment to the owner on the design. BookCrossing's library profile pages not only shows them the name, description, location,
                  and a picture, but it enables users the ability to contribute to the community as well as see how other people have contributed
                  to a given library.
